# Introduction

## Motivation

Across many fields, decision makers face the problem of assessing and mitigating the risk associated with rare, extreme events. For instance, institutions seek accurate models of financial losses to design strategies that reduce their exposure, while an understanding of rare environmental phenomena, such as floods or hurricanes, guides the development of resilient defence infrastructure and public safety measures. Extreme value theory (EVT) provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for analysing the stochastic behaviour of such events. In particular, EVT is underpinned by asymptotic arguments that allow the probability law to be extrapolated beyond the maxima of the observed data. In principle, one can estimate the risk of unprecedented occurrences of a magnitude that has not been observed previously. Naively assuming that such events are impossible (as one might conclude from an empirical approach) could have catastrophic consequences; equally, overestimating the probability of such events leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. Effective risk management therefore involves evaluating and managing the trade-off between events' impacts and their probabilities. The latter aspect falls under the remit of EVT and, by extension, this thesis.

The concept of extremal dependence is central to assessing the risk of joint extreme events involving several different variables or interacting systems. In many practical scenarios, extreme events do not occur in isolation but are fundamentally interconnected. For example, simultaneous extreme rainfall across multiple regions can lead to compounded flood risks, or the co-occurrence of extreme market crashes in different sectors can exacerbate market instability. Accounting for these associations is a critical part of risk modelling. For example, suppose a fund manager oversees a portfolio of $d$ stocks and let $X_i$ denote the daily negative log-return of the $i$th stock for $i=1,\ldots,d$. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a popular tool for assessing the portfolio risk in terms of total portfolio loss over a one-day horizon, defined as the $(1-\alpha)$ quantile of the portfolio loss $L=\sum_{i=1}^d w_iX_i$, where $w_i$ represents the relative weight of stock $i$ in the portfolio and $\alpha$ is a prescribed confidence level. If one assumes that extreme losses are independent the Value-at-Risk may appear rather small. However, financial crises or sudden macroeconomic shocks often cause simultaneous and correlated extreme losses across multiple stocks due to shared exposure to systemic risk factors and herd behaviour among investors. The dependence structure of $(X_1,\ldots,X_d)$ influences the quantile behaviour of $L$ and consequently impacts the value-at-risk. One solution to alleviate this risk is portfolio diversification, whereby the fund manager balances exposure across different asset classes and markets. 

Modelling extremal dependence is especially challenging when the number of variables under consideration is large. High-dimensional extremal dependence arises in applications such as environmental science, where a climatic variable is studied across multiple sites in a spatial domain, or in large-scale financial portfolios, where dependencies among asset extremes can significantly impact portfolio risk. In such settings the curse of dimensionality, the complexity of the dependence structure, and the inherent scarcity of relevant data points all hamper efforts to model the probabilistic structure of the joint tail. Advancing methods to analyse extremal dependence in high dimensions is critical for addressing real-world, large-scale problems. This is the overarching goal of this thesis. 

One particularly useful tool for understanding high-dimensional extremal dependence is the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM) developed by @cooleyDecompositionsDependenceHighdimensional2019. The TPDM provides a compact summary of extremal dependence among pairs of variables by quantifying their joint tail behaviour, similar to a covariance/correlation matrix in non-extreme statistics. This facilitates the exploration of key dependence patterns and underpins a whole host of recently developed tools for analysing multivariate extremes, including dimension reduction tools [@cooleyDecompositionsDependenceHighdimensional2019; @dreesPrincipalComponentAnalysis2021; @fomichovSphericalClusteringDetection2023; @richardsModernExtremeValue2024] and methods for fitting parametric models [@fixSimultaneousAutoregressiveModels2021; @kirilioukEstimatingProbabilitiesMultivariate2022]. By leveraging the TPDM, it becomes possible to develop efficient and scalable methods for modelling extremal dependence, thereby addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional settings while maintaining computational feasibility. This thesis proposes new applications of this matrix to add to the toolbox of TPDM-based techniques for analysing multivariate extremes. 

## Thesis aims and outline

The primary aim of this thesis is to develop statistical applications of the TPDM. This includes entirely new methodologies, extensions of existing ones, or 

Each chapter of this thesis explores a specific topic related to the TPDM and multivariate extremes. Chapter XX3 and Chapter XX5 develop new tools for analysing multivariate extreme events via the TPDM. Chapter XX4 highlights and addresses some limitations of existing TPDM tools via an alternative characterisation of extreme events and tail correlation based on compositional data analysis. Chapter XX6 concerns estimation of the TPDM and addresses deficiencies of the standard estimator. Our new estimators may be immediately incorporated into existing frameworks or future ones, possibly including those discussed in Chapter XX7. The rest of this section describes the structure of the thesis.

Chapter XX2 provides an overview of univariate and multivariate extreme value statistics before introducing the main protagonist of the thesis, the TPDM. We summarise and illustrate its key theoretical properties, which will be called upon in future chapters. Additionally, we survey the TPDM-related literature to familiarise the reader with its existing applications. By conducting a critical review of these methods, we are able to identify potential weaknesses and gaps to be addressed and filled in the later chapters. The chapter concludes with some simulation experiments illustrating a known deficiency of the standard TPDM estimator, whereby it is biased in weak-dependence scenarios. Although the bias itself is not of direct interest until Chapter XX6, issues stemming from it will be pointed out at various points during the thesis.

Chapter XX3 presents a statistical procedure to test for temporal non-stationarity in the extremal dependence structure of a (potentially high-dimensional) random vector indexed by time. This is motivated by the need to validate the ubiquitous assumption that extreme observations are identically distributed over time. To formulate our test, we define a time-dependent extension of the TPDM and test for deviations in this object. While existing tests are restricted to low dimensions, our test scales to high dimensions because it is rooted in the TPDM. The performance of the test across a range of scenarios is illustrated using simulation experiments. Our application to Red Sea surface temperature extremes corroborates the theory that the region is undergoing changes driven by climate change.

Chapter XX4 explores connections between multivariate extremes and compositional data analysis (CoDA). Observing that both disciplines boil down to analysing distributions on the simplex, we argue that off-the-shelf CoDA tools are an underutilised resource among the extremes community. Our simulation experiments show how compositional PCA yields more efficient and interpretable dimension reduction compared to the TPDM-based method of @dreesPrincipalComponentAnalysis2021. We also investigate the use of CoDA techniques for binary classification of extreme events. Our results show that accounting for the geometry of the sample space (i.e. the simplex) can enhance predictive performance significantly.

Chapter XX5 summarises the techniques employed by team 'Uniofbathtopia' as part of a data competition organised for the 13th International Conference on Extreme Value Analysis (EVA2023). The competition comprised of four sub-challenges focussing on a multitude of aspects from univariate and multivariate extremes; additional information and context are provided in @sec-eva-preliminary and the editorial @Rohr23. @sec-eva-univariate details our submission for the univariate sub-challenges (Challenges 1 and 2); this section was researched and written by H. Elsom. The multivariate tasks (Challenges 3 and 4) are the subject of @sec-eva-multivariate, which was researched and written by myself. In Challenge 3 (@sec-eva-c3), we combine sparse simplex projections with a flexible parametric model to obtain probability estimates for joint extreme events involving different combinations of variables. The accuracy of the estimates was such that we topped the rankings for this sub-challenge. For Challenge 4 (@sec-eva-c3) we combine clustering and completely positive factorisations of the TPDM [@kirilioukEstimatingProbabilitiesMultivariate2022] to estimate exceedingly rare events in high dimensions. Our post-hoc analysis reveals that unreliable TPDM estimation hindered our performance. A possible solution (based on the sparse projections from Challenge 3) is proposed; we study this issue in more detail in the following chapter.  

Chapter XX6 blah blah blah.

The thesis concludes with a summary and discussion of future research avenues in Chapter XX7.
