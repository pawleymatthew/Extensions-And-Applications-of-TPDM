	abstract = {The areal modeling of the extremes of a natural process such as rainfall or temperature is important in environmental statistics; for example, understanding extreme areal rainfall is crucial in flood protection. This article reviews recent progress in the statistical modeling of spatial extremes, starting with sketches of the necessary elements of extreme value statistics and geostatistics. The main types of statistical models thus far proposed, based on latent variables, on copulas and on spatial max-stable processes, are described and then are compared by application to a data set on rainfall in Switzerland. Whereas latent variable modeling allows a better fit to marginal distributions, it fits the joint distributions of extremes poorly, so appropriately-chosen copula or max-stable models seem essential for successful spatial modeling of extremes. Key words and phrases : Annual maximum analysis, Bayesian hierarchical model, Brown-Resnick process, composite likelihood, copula, environmental data analysis, Gaussian process, generalized extreme-value distribution, geostatistics, latent variable, max-stable process, statistics of extremes.},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of statistical climatology is to extract relevant information hidden in complex spatial–temporal climatological datasets. To identify spatial patterns, most well-known statistical techniques are based on the concept of intra- and intercluster variances (like the k-means algorithm or EOFs). As analyzing quantitative extremes like heavy rainfall has become more and more prevalent for climatologists and hydrologists during these last decades, ﬁnding spatial patterns with methods based on deviations from the mean (i.e., variances) may not be the most appropriate strategy in this context of studying such extremes. For practitioners, simple and fast clustering tools tailored for extremes have been lacking. A possible avenue to bridging this methodological gap resides in taking advantage of multivariate extreme value theory, a welldeveloped research ﬁeld in probability, and to adapt it to the context of spatial clustering. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on this plan is proposed and studied. The approach is compared and discussed with respect to the classical k-means algorithm throughout the analysis of weekly maxima of hourly precipitation recorded in France (fall season, 92 stations, 1993–2011).},

            We propose a method for analyzing extremal behavior through the lens of a most efficient basis of vectors. The method is analogous to principal component analysis, but is based on methods from extreme value analysis. Specifically, rather than decomposing a covariance or correlation matrix, we obtain our basis vectors by performing an eigendecomposition of a matrix that describes pairwise extremal dependence. We apply the method to precipitation observations over the contiguous United States. We find that the time series of large coefficients associated with the leading eigenvector shows very strong evidence of a positive trend, and there is evidence that large coefficients of other eigenvectors have relationships with El Niño–Southern Oscillation.},

A heuristic criterion is proposed to choose the threshold over which it is acceptable to consider observations as extreme and the appropriate number of clusters.

	abstract = {Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g., portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (nonparametric) characterization of extreme dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable ‘‘directions’’ of extremes, i.e., the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the largest observations. Modeling the angular measure in highdimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a particular kind of sparsity within the dependence structure of extremes. This is achieved by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions corresponding to specific sub-cones of Rd+. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a first anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse normal profile of extreme behaviors, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.},

Multivariate peaks-over-threshold methods, in contrast, exploit additional information from the non-aggregated 'large' observations. We introduce an approach based on peaks over thresholds that provides several new estimators for processes 77 in the max-domain of attraction of the frequently used Hüsler-Reiss model and its spatial extension: Brown-Resnick processes. The method relies on increments //(•) - r;(f0) conditional on r/(f0) exceeding a high threshold, where t0 is a fixed location. When the marginals are standardized to the Gumbel distribution, these increments asymptotically form a Gaussian process resulting in computationally simple estimates of the Hüsler-Reiss parameter matrix and particularly enables parametric inference for Brown-Resnick processes based on (high dimensional) multivariate densities. This is a major advantage over composite likelihood methods that are commonly used in spatial extreme value statistics since they rely only on bivariate densities. A simulation study compares the performance of the new estimators with other commonly used methods. As an application, we fit a non-isotropic Brown-Resnick process to the extremes of 12-year data of daily wind speed measurements.},

Our extreme SAR model extends recent work on transformed-linear operations applied to regularly varying random vectors, and is unique among extremes models in being directly analogous to a classical linear model. An additional appeal is its simplicity; given a proximity matrix W, spatial dependence is described by a single parameter 𝜌. We develop an estimation method that minimizes the discrepancy between the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM) for the fitted model and the estimated TPDM. Applying this method to simulated data demonstrates that it is able to produce good estimates of extremal spatial dependence even in the case of model misspecification, and additionally produces reasonable estimates of uncertainty. We also apply the method to gridded precipitation observations for a study region over northeast Colorado, and find that a single-parameter extreme SAR model paired with a neighborhood structure which accounts for longer range dependence effectively models spatial dependence in these data.},

In particular, we derive the asymptotic distribution of extremes arising from a linear factor model and prove that, under certain conditions, spectral clustering can consistently identify the clusters of extremes arising in this model. Leveraging this result we propose a simple consistent estimation strategy for learning the angular measure.

In statistics, multivariate extreme value theory is often used to model spatial extremes. However, most commonly used approaches require strong assumptions and are either too simplistic or over-parameterized. From a machine learning perspective, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a powerful tool to model dependencies in high-dimensional spaces. Yet in the standard setting, GANs do not well represent dependencies in the extremes. Here we combine GANs with extreme value theory (evtGAN) to model spatial dependencies in summer maxima of temperature and winter maxima in precipitation over a large part of western Europe. We use data from a stationary 2000-year climate model simulation to validate the approach and explore its sensitivity to small sample sizes. Our results show that evtGAN outperforms classical GANs and standard statistical approaches to model spatial extremes. Already with about 50 years of data, which corresponds to commonly available climate records, we obtain reasonably good performance. In general, dependencies between temperature extremes are better captured than dependencies between precipitation extremes due to the high spatial coherence in temperature fields. Our approach can be applied to other climate variables and can be used to emulate climate models when running very long simulations to determine dependencies in the extremes is deemed infeasible.},

The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justiﬁed limit models such as max-stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this ﬁeld has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that allows the deﬁnition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley–Cliﬀord theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of Hu¨sler–Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read oﬀ from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simpliﬁed to lower-dimensional marginals.

            In multivariate extreme value analysis, the nature of the extremal dependence between variables should be considered when selecting appropriate statistical models. Interest often lies in determining which subsets of variables can take their largest values simultaneously while the others are of smaller order. Our approach to this problem exploits hidden regular variation properties on a collection of nonstandard cones, and provides a new set of indices that reveal aspects of the extremal dependence structure not available through existing measures of dependence. We derive theoretical properties of these indices, demonstrate their utility through a series of examples, and develop methods of inference that also estimate the proportion of extremal mass associated with each cone. We apply the methods to river flows in the U.K., estimating the probabilities of different subsets of sites being large simultaneously.},

We propose a radial transformation that does not require zero substitutions and more importantly results in essential equivalence between domains before and after the transformation. We show that a rich class of kernels on hyperspheres can successfully define a kernel embedding for compositional data based on this equivalence.

	abstract = {An important problem in extreme-value theory is the estimation of the probability that a high-dimensional random vector falls into a given extreme failure set. This paper provides a parametric approach to this problem, based on a generalization of the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM). The TPDM gives a partial summary of tail dependence for all pairs of components of the random vector. We propose an algorithm to obtain an approximate completely positive decomposition of the TPDM. The decomposition is easy to compute and applicable to moderate to high dimensions. Based on the decomposition, we obtain parameters estimates of a max-linear model whose TPDM is equal to that of the original random vector. We apply the proposed decomposition algorithm to industry portfolio returns and maximal wind speeds to illustrate its applicability.},

We begin by developing an inner product space constructed from transformed-linear combinations of independent regularly varying random variables. We define partial tail correlation via the projection theorem for the inner product space. We show that the partial tail correlation can be understood as the inner product of the prediction errors from transformed-linear prediction. We connect partial tail correlation to the inverse of the inner product matrix and show that a zero in this inverse implies a partial tail correlation of zero. We then show that under a modeling assumption that the random variables belong to a sensible subset of the inner product space, the matrix of inner products corresponds to the previously-studied tail pairwise dependence matrix. We develop a hypothesis test for partial tail correlation of zero. We demonstrate the performance in two applications: high nitrogen dioxide levels in Washington DC and extreme river discharges in the upper Danube basin.},

            There is growing empirical evidence that spherical \$k\$-means clustering performs well at identifying groups of concomitant extremes in high dimensions, thereby leading to sparse models. We provide one of the first theoretical results supporting this approach, but also demonstrate some pitfalls. Furthermore, we show that an alternative cost function may be more appropriate for identifying concomitant extremes, and it results in a novel spherical \$k\$-principal-components clustering algorithm. Our main result establishes a broadly satisfied sufficient condition guaranteeing the success of this method, albeit in a rather basic setting. Finally, we illustrate in simulations that \$k\$-principal components clustering outperforms \$k\$-means clustering in the difficult case of weak asymptotic dependence within the groups.},

Here, we develop a statistical framework to test for spatial dependence and show widespread dependence of temperature and precipitation extremes in observations and model simulations, with more frequent than expected concurrence of extremes around the world. Historical anthropogenic forcing has strengthened the concurrence of temperature extremes over 56\% of 946 global paired regions, particularly in the tropics, but has not yet significantly affected concurrent precipitation extremes during 1901–2020. The future high-emissions pathway of SSP585 will substantially amplify the concurrence strength, intensity, and spatial extent for both temperature and precipitation extremes, especially over tropical and boreal regions, while the mitigation pathway of SSP126 can ameliorate the increase in concurrent climate extremes for these high-risk regions. Our findings will inform adaptation strategies to alleviate the impact of future climate extremes.

In the multivariate setting, the spectral measure characterizes the dependence structure of the extremes. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and often has sparse support since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is deﬁned through weak convergence, which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation, which makes it possible to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex, for which efﬁcient algorithms are known.

In a wide variety of applications, ranging from ﬁnance/insurance to environmental sciences through teletrafﬁc data analysis for instance, extreme (i.e. very large) observations X are of crucial importance, while contributing in a negligible manner to the (empirical) error however, simply because of their rarity. As a consequence, empirical risk minimizers generally perform very poorly in extreme regions. It is the purpose of this paper to develop a general framework for classiﬁcation in the extremes. Precisely, under non-parametric heavy-tail assumptions for the class distributions, we prove that a natural and asymptotic notion of risk, accounting for predictive performance in extreme regions of the input space, can be deﬁned and show that minimizers of an empirical version of a non-asymptotic approximant of this dedicated risk, based on a fraction of the largest observations, lead to classiﬁcation rules with good generalization capacity, by means of maximal deviation inequalities in low probability regions. Beyond theoretical results, numerical experiments are presented in order to illustrate the relevance of the approach developed.},

	abstract = {Extreme-value copulas arise as the limiting dependence structure of component-wise maxima. Deﬁned in terms of a functional parameter, they are one of the most widespread copula families due to their ﬂexibility and ability to capture asymmetry. Despite this, meeting the complex analytical properties of this parameter in an unconstrained setting remains a challenge, restricting most uses to models with very few parameters or nonparametric models. Focusing on the bivariate case, we propose a novel semiparametric approach. Our procedure relies on a series of transformations, including Williamson’s transform and starting from a zero-integral spline. Without further constraints, wholly compliant solutions can be eﬃciently obtained through maximum likelihood estimation, leveraging gradient optimization. We successfully conducted several experiments on simulated and real-world data. Our method outperforms another well-known nonparametric technique over small and medium-sized samples in various settings. Its expressiveness is illustrated with precious data gathered by the gravitational wave detection LIGO and Virgo collaborations.},

We place ourselves in a Peaks-Over-Threshold framework where a functional extreme is defined as an observation 𝑋 whose 𝐿2-norm ‖𝑋‖ is comparatively large. Our goal is to propose a dimension reduction framework resulting into finite dimensional projections for such extreme observations. Our contribution is double. First, we investigate the notion of Regular Variation for random quantities valued in a general separable Hilbert space, for which we propose a novel concrete characterization involving solely stochastic convergence of real-valued random variables. Second, we propose a notion of functional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accounting for the principal ‘directions’ of functional extremes. We investigate the statistical properties of the empirical covariance operator of the angular component of extreme functions, by upper-bounding the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of the estimation error for finite sample sizes. Numerical experiments with simulated and real data illustrate this work.},

	abstract = {In compositional data analysis, an observation is a vector containing nonnegative values, only the relative sizes of which are considered to be of interest. Without loss of generality, a compositional vector can be taken to be a vector of proportions that sum to one. Data of this type arise in many areas including geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political science. In this paper we investigate methods for classiﬁcation of compositional data. Our approach centers on the idea of using the α-transformation to transform the data and then to classify the transformed data via regularized discriminant analysis and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Using the α-transformation generalizes two rival approaches in compositional data analysis, one (when α=1) that treats the data as though they were Euclidean, ignoring the compositional constraint, and another (when α = 0) that employs Aitchison’s centered log-ratio transformation. A numerical study with several real datasets shows that whether using α = 1 or α = 0 gives better classiﬁcation performance depends on the dataset, and moreover that using an intermediate value of α can sometimes give better performance than using either 1 or 0.},

@article{greenacreChiPowerTransformationValid2024,
	title = {The {chiPower} transformation: a valid alternative to logratio transformations in compositional data analysis},
	volume = {18},
	abstract = {The approach to analysing compositional data has been dominated by the use of logratio transformations, to ensure exact subcompositional coherence and, in some situations, exact isometry as well. A problem with this approach is that data zeros, found in most applications, have to be replaced to allow the logarithmic transformation. An alternative new approach, called the ‘chiPower’ transformation, which allows data zeros, is to combine the standardization inherent in the chi-square distance in correspondence analysis, with the essential elements of the Box-Cox power transformation. The chiPower transformation is justified because it defines between-sample distances that tend to logratio distances for strictly positive data as the power parameter tends to zero, and are then equivalent to transforming to logratios. For data with zeros, a value of the power can be identified that brings the chiPower transformation as close as possible to a logratio transformation, without having to substitute the zeros. Especially in the area of high-dimensional data, this alternative approach can present such a high level of coherence and isometry as to be a valid approach to the analysis of compositional data. Furthermore, in a supervised learning context, if the compositional variables serve as predictors of a response in a modelling framework, for example generalized linear models, then the power can be used as a tuning parameter in optimizing the accuracy of prediction through cross-validation. The chiPower-transformed variables have a straightforward interpretation, since they are each identified with single compositional parts, not ratios.},

A heat wave deﬁnition based on EPI is able to detect the most important heat waves over Europe. As an extension for considering simultaneous extremes in two variables, we propose the threshold-based EPI (TEPI) that captures the compound character of spatial extremes. We investigate daily temperature maxima and precipitation deﬁcits at different accumulation times and ﬁnd evidence that preceding precipitation deﬁcits have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the development of heat waves and that heat waves often co-occur with short-term drought conditions.

We present a modern toolbox of four methodological frameworks, motivated by classical extreme value theory, that can be used to accurately estimate extreme exceedance probabilities or the corresponding level in either a univariate or multivariate setting. Our frameworks were used to facilitate the winning contribution of Team Yalla to the EVA (2023) Conference Data Challenge, which was organised for the 13th International Conference on Extreme Value Analysis. This competition comprised seven teams competing across four separate sub-challenges, with each requiring the modelling of data simulated from known, yet highly complex, statistical distributions, and extrapolation far beyond the range of the available samples in order to predict probabilities of extreme events. Data were constructed to be representative of real environmental data, sampled from the fantasy country of “Utopia”.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel extremal dependence measure called the partial tail-correlation coefficient (PTCC), in analogy to the partial correlation coefficient in classical multivariate analysis. The construction of our new coefficient is based on the framework of multivariate regular variation and transformed-linear algebra operations. We show how this coefficient allows identifying pairs of variables that have partially uncorrelated tails given some other variables in a random vector. Unlike other recently introduced conditional independence frameworks for extremes, our approach requires minimal modeling assumptions and can thus be used in exploratory analyses to learn the structure of extremal graphical models. Similarly to traditional Gaussian graphical models where edges correspond to the nonzero entries of the precision matrix, we can exploit classical inference methods for high-dimensional data, such as the graphical Lasso with Laplacian spectral constraints, to efficiently learn the extremal network structure via the PTCC. We apply our new method to study extreme risk networks in two different datasets (extreme river discharges and historical global currency exchange data) and show that we can extract interesting extremal structures with meaningful domainspecific interpretations.},

Algorithms based on finite approximations are often inexact and computationally inefficient. We present a new algorithm for exact simulation of a max-stable process at a finite number of locations. It relies on the idea of simulating only the extremal functions, that is, those functions in the construction of a max-stable process that effectively contribute to the pointwise maximum. We further generalize the algorithm by Dieker \& Mikosch (2015) for Brown–Resnick processes and use it for exact simulation via the spectral measure. We study the complexity of both algorithms, prove that our new approach via extremal functions is always more efficient, and provide closed-form expressions for their implementation that cover most popular models for max-stable processes and multivariate extreme value distributions. For simulation on dense grids, an adaptive design of the extremal function algorithm is proposed.},

In a number of applications, no pre-processing of the data is carried out, and it is the uncentred data matrix that is subjected to an SVD, in what is often called an uncentred PCA. This paper explores the relationships between the results from both the standard, column-centred, PCA, and its uncentred counterpart. In particular, it obtains both exact results and bounds relating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariation matrices, as well as the principal components, in both types of analysis. These relationships highlight how the eigenvalues of both the covariance matrix and the matrix of non-central second moments contain much information that is highly informative for a comparative assessment of PCA and its uncentred variant. The relations and the examples also suggest that the results of both types of PCA have more in common than might be supposed.},

	abstract = {Maps of extreme snow depths are important for structural design and general risk assessment in mountainous countries like Austria. The smooth modeling approach is commonly accepted to provide more accurate margins than max-stable processes. In contrast, max-stable models allow for risk estimation due to explicitly available spatial extremal dependencies, in particular when anisotropy is accounted for. However, the difference in return levels is unclear, when modeled smoothly or with max-stable processes. The objective of this study is twofold: ﬁrst, to investigate that question and to provide snow depth return level maps for Austria; and second, to investigate spatial dependencies of extreme snow depths in Austria in detail and to ﬁnd a suitable model for risk estimation. Therefore, a model selection procedure was used to deﬁne a marginal model for the GEV parameters. This model was ﬁtted to 210 snow depth series comprising a length of 42 years using the smooth model approach and different max-stable models allowing for anisotropy. Despite relatively clear advantages for the Extremal-t maxstable process based on two scores compared to the smooth model as well as the Brown–Resnick, Geometric Gaussian and Schlather processes, the difference in 100-year snow depth return levels is too small, to decide which approach works better. Spatial dependencies of snow depth extremes between the regions north and south of the Austrian Alps are almost independent. Dependencies are stronger in the south for small distances between station pairs up to 120 km and become stronger in the north for larger distances. For risk modeling the Austrian Alps could be separated into regions north and south of the Alps. Fitting an anisotropic Extremal-t max-stable process to either side of the Alps can improve modeling of joint exceedance probabilities compared to one single model for the whole of Austria, especially for small station distances.},

Motivated by this fact, in this work we develop an M-estimation framework for max-stable models based on the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) of multivariate CDFs. We start by establishing conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the CRPSbased estimators in a general context. We then implement them in the max-stable setting and provide readily computable expressions for their asymptotic covariance matrices. The resulting point and asymptotic confidence interval estimates are illustrated over popular simulated models. They enjoy accurate coverages and offer an alternative to composite likelihood based methods.},

The estimator is easy to calculate and applies to a wide range of sampling schemes and tail dependence models. In large samples, it is asymptotically normal with an explicit and estimable covariance matrix. The minimum distance obtained forms the basis of a goodness-of-fit statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chi-square. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm the excellent finite-sample performance of the estimator and demonstrate that it is a strong competitor to currently available methods.

Multivariate extreme value theory provides a principled framework for the modeling and estimation of extremal dependence. In practice, however, this involves dealing with a challenging infinite dimensional parameter such as the spectral measure. Here, following recent developments in Schlather and Tawn (Extremes 5(1), 87–102, 2002), Molchanov (Extremes 11, 235–259, 2008), and Strokorb and Schlather (2013), we propose to represent extremal dependence of a multivariate portfolio via the so–called Tawn–Molchanov (TM) model, which is finite dimensional. Every max–stable random vector X can be associated with a TM max-stable vector Y = TM(X) so that the extremal coefficients of X and Y match and at the same time Y stochastically dominates X in the lower orthant order. This result readily yields an optimal upper bound on the value-at-risk VaRα(X∨) of the maximum portfolio loss X∨ := maxj=1,...,d Xj . We develop a statistical methodology for estimating TM models from data and illustrate the resulting upper bounds on VaRα(X∨) with simulations and real data. Fitting TM models to portfolio data may be of independent practical interest, since their coefficients provide a qualitative picture of the degree and nature of diversification to extreme shocks.},

	abstract = {Among bivariate tail dependence measures, the tail dependence coefficient has emerged as the popular choice. Akin to the correlation matrix, a multivariate dependence measure is constructed using these bivariate measures, and this is referred to in the literature as the tail dependence matrix (TDM). While the problem of determining whether a given d × d matrix is a correlation matrix is of the order O(d3) in complexity, determining if a matrix is a TDM (the realization problem) is believed to be non-polynomial in complexity. Using a linear programming (LP) formulation, we show that the combinatorial structure of the constraints is related to the intractable max-cut problem in a weighted graph. This connection provides an avenue for constructing parametric classes admitting a polynomial in d algorithm for determining membership in its constraint polytope. The complexity of the general realization problem is justifiably of much theoretical interest. Since in practice one resorts to lower dimensional parametrization of the TDMs, we posit that it is rather the complexity of the realization problem restricted to parametric classes of TDMs, and algorithms for it, that are more practically relevant. In this paper, we show how the inherent symmetry and sparsity in a parametrization can be exploited to achieve a significant reduction in the LP formulation, which can lead to polynomial complexity of such realization problems - some parametrizations even resulting in the constraint polytope being independent of d. We also explore the use of a probabilistic viewpoint on TDMs to derive the constraint polytopes.},

From this it has long been assumed that this implies that the question of whether or not the strong membership problem for the dual of the copositive cone, the completely positive cone, is also an NP-hard problem. However, the technical details for this have not previously been looked at to conﬁrm that this is true. In this paper it is proven that the strong membership problem for the completely positive cone is indeed NP-hard. Furthermore, it is shown that even the weak membership problems for both of these cones are NP-hard. We also present an alternative proof of the NP-hardness of the strong membership problem for the copositive cone.},

This paper is a statistical extreme-event risk attribution study that aims to answer whether extreme wildﬁre seasons are more likely now than under past climate. This requires modeling temporal dependence at extreme levels. We propose the use of transformed-linear time series models, which are constructed similarly to traditional autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models while having a dependence structure that is tied to a widely used framework for extremes (regular variation). We ﬁt the models to the extreme values of the seasonally adjusted ﬁre weather index (FWI) time series to capture the dependence in the upper tail for past and present climate. We simulate 10 000 ﬁre seasons from each ﬁtted model and compare the proportion of simulated high-risk ﬁre seasons to quantify the increase in risk. Our method suggests that the risk of experiencing an extreme wildﬁre season in Grand Lake, Colorado, under current climate has increased dramatically relative to the risk under the climate of the mid-twentieth century. Our method also ﬁnds some evidence of increased risk of extreme wildﬁre seasons in Quincy, California, but large uncertainties do not allow us to reject a null hypothesis of no change.},

More speciﬁcally, we focus on the asymptotic dependence of multivariate extremes characterized by the angular or spectral measure in extreme value theory and provide a careful analysis in the case where the extremes are generated from a linear factor model. We give theoretical guarantees on the performance of kernel PCA preimages of such extremes by leveraging their asymptotic distribution together with Davis-Kahan perturbation bounds.

	abstract = {We develop a method for probabilistic prediction of extreme value hot-spots in a spatio-temporal framework, tailored to big datasets containing important gaps. In this setting, direct calculation of summaries from data, such as the minimum over a space-time domain, is not possible. To obtain predictive distributions for such cluster summaries, we propose a two-step approach. We first model marginal distributions with a focus on accurate modeling of the right tail and then, after transforming the data to a standard Gaussian scale, we estimate a Gaussian space-time dependence model defined locally in the time domain for the space-time subregions where we want to predict. In the first step, we detrend the mean and standard deviation of the data and fit a spatially resolved generalized Pareto distribution to apply a correction of the upper tail. To ensure spatial smoothness of the estimated trends, we either pool data using nearest-neighbor techniques, or apply generalized additive regression modeling. To cope with high space-time resolution of data, the local Gaussian models use a Markov representation of the Mate´rn correlation function based on the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) approach. In the second step, they are fitted in a Bayesian framework through the integrated nested Laplace approximation implemented in R-INLA. Finally, posterior samples are generated to provide statistical inferences through Monte-Carlo estimation. Motivated by the 2019 Extreme Value Analysis data challenge, we illustrate our approach to predict the distribution of local space-time minima in anomalies of Red Sea surface temperatures, using a gridded dataset (11315 days, 16703 pixels) with artificially generated gaps. In particular, we show the improved performance of our two-step approach over a purely Gaussian model without tail transformations.},

	abstract = {Recent extreme value theory literature has seen significant emphasis on the modelling of spatial extremes, with comparatively little consideration of spatio-temporal extensions. This neglects an important feature of extreme events: their evolution over time. Many existing models for the spatial case are limited by the number of locations they can handle; this impedes extension to space–time settings, where models for higher dimensions are required. Moreover, the spatio-temporal models that do exist are restrictive in terms of the range of extremal dependence types they can capture. Recently, conditional approaches for studying multivariate and spatial extremes have been proposed, which enjoy benefits in terms of computational efficiency and an ability to capture both asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence. We extend this class of models to a spatio-temporal setting, conditioning on the occurrence of an extreme value at a single space–time location. We adopt a composite likelihood approach for inference, which combines information from full likelihoods across multiple space–time conditioning locations. We apply our model to Red Sea surface temperatures, show that it fits well using a range of diagnostic plots, and demonstrate how it can be used to assess the risk of coral bleaching attributed to high water temperatures over consecutive days.},

Spatial modelling of extreme values is no exception, with one of the most common such assumptions being stationarity in the marginal and/or dependence features. If non-stationarity has been detected in the marginal distributions, it is tempting to try to model this while assuming stationarity in the dependence, without necessarily putting this latter assumption through thorough testing. However, margins and dependence are often intricately connected and the detection of non-stationarity in one feature might affect the detection of non-stationarity in the other. This work is an in-depth case study of this interrelationship, with a particular focus on a spatio-temporal environmental application exhibiting well-documented marginal non-stationarity. Specifically, we compare and contrast four different marginal detrending approaches in terms of our post-detrending ability to detect temporal non-stationarity in the spatial extremal dependence structure of a sea surface temperature dataset from the Red Sea.},

	abstract = {Falling between the dynamics of the seasonal cycle and expressions of longer-term trends, the interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Red Sea has not received enough attention. With multiple decades of satellite SST observations with spatial resolution capable of resolving patterns of variability within the Red Sea, the time has come for a description and diagnosis of the observed interannual variability of SST in this important semienclosed sea. While interannual variability of SST occurs throughout the Red Sea in both summer and winter, the greatest variability is found in the northern Red Sea during winter. Objective analysis reveals two dominant statistical modes of interannual variability of Red Sea SST: a whole-sea mode described by general warm or cool anomalies throughout the Red Sea (∼60\% of total variance), and a meridional gradient mode of opposing SST anomalies in the northern and southern Red Sea (∼20\% of total variance). The warm phase of the whole-sea mode corresponds to warm surface air temperature anomalies extending across the broader region and local surface wind anomalies opposite to the mean low-level circulation. The whole-sea mode is found to be a regional response to remote forcing by the East Atlantic/Western Russia (EAWR) pattern. The gradient mode, on the other hand, is a manifestation of superimposing (and statistically independent) remote impacts of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) whereby ENSO drives SST anomalies in the southern Red Sea and the NAO drives SST anomalies in the northern Red Sea. Plain Language Summary The Red Sea is climatically, ecologically, and economically important. The temperature at the surface of a body of water is a reliable indicator of its climatic and ecological conditions, and is readily observable from ships and Earth-orbiting satellites. Studying Red Sea temperature ﬂuctuations from decades of such observations reveal what physical factors affect the temperature and currents within the Red Sea, both near and far. We found that the year-to-year ﬂuctuations in Red Sea temperature are affected by three factors: (1) the air temperature of the Middle East region, (2) an arctic climate cycle called the North Atlantic Oscillation, and (3) a tropical climate cycle known as El Niño. These three factors cause temperature ﬂuctuations in the Red Sea by affecting how much heat can be exchanged between the Red Sea and the atmosphere above. With this knowledge, it may be possible to predict Red Sea temperature ﬂuctuations in advance, especially given that El Niño is predictable.},

In this context which has recently been analysed from an Extreme Value Analysis perspective, the risk function measures the algorithm’s error given that the norm of the input exceeds a high quantile. The main challenge within this framework is the negligible size of the extreme training sample with respect to the full sample size and the necessity to re-scale the risk function by a probability tending to zero. We open the road to a ﬁnite sample understanding of CV for extreme values by establishing two new results: an exponential probability bound on the K-fold CV error and a polynomial probability bound on the leave-p-out CV. Our bounds are sharp in the sense that they match state-of-the-art guarantees for standard CV estimates while extending them to encompass a conditioning event of small probability. We illustrate the signiﬁcance of our results regarding high dimensional classiﬁcation in extreme regions via a Lasso-type logistic regression algorithm. The tightness of our bounds is investigated in numerical experiments.},

We model the daily maximum and minimum RoR vectors (potentially transformed) using the bivariate Hu¨sler-Reiss (BHR) distribution. To estimate the changepoint in the χ-measure of the BHR distribution, we explore two changepoint detection procedures based on the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and Modified Information Criterion (MIC). We obtain critical values and power curves of the LRT and MIC test statistics for low through high values of χ-measure. We also explore the consistency of the estimators of the changepoint based on LRT and MIC numerically. In our data application, for RoR maxima and minima, the most prominent changepoints detected by LRT and MIC are close to the announcement of the first phases of lockdown and unlock, respectively, which are realistic; thus, our study would be beneficial for portfolio optimization in the case of future pandemic situations.},

Many existing threshold selection methods do not address this trade-off directly but rather aim to select the lowest threshold above which the generalized Pareto model is judged to hold approximately. In the paper Bayesian cross-validation is used to address the trade-off by comparing thresholds based on predictive ability at extreme levels. Extremal inferences can be sensitive to the choice of a single threshold. We use Bayesian model averaging to combine inferences from many thresholds, thereby reducing sensitivity to the choice of a single threshold.

	abstract = {Generalized additive model (GAM) forms offer a flexible approach to capturing marginal variation. Such forms are used here to represent distributional variation in extreme values and presented in terms of spatiotemporal variation, which is often evident in environmental processes. A two-stage procedure is proposed that identifies extreme values as exceedances of a high threshold, which is defined as a fixed quantile and estimated by quantile regression. Excesses of the threshold are modelled with the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). GAM forms are adopted for the threshold and GPD parameters, and directly estimated—in particular smoothing parameters—by restricted maximum likelihood, which provides an objective and relatively fast method of inference. The GAM models are used to produce return level maps for extreme wind gust speeds over the United States, which show extreme quantiles of the distribution of annual maximum gust speeds.

	abstract = {Multivariate extreme value theory and methods concern the characterization, estimation and extrapolation of the joint tail of the distribution of a d-dimensional random variable. Existing approaches are based on limiting arguments in which all components of the variable become large at the same rate. This limit approach is inappropriate when the extreme values of all the variables are unlikely to occur together or when interest is in regions of the support of the joint distribution where only a subset of components is extreme. In practice this restricts existing methods to applications where d is typically 2 or 3. Under an assumption about the asymptotic form of the joint distribution of a d-dimensional random variable conditional on its having an extreme component, we develop an entirely new semiparametric approach which overcomes these existing restrictions and can be applied to problems of any dimension. We demonstrate the performance of our approach and its advantages over existing methods by using theoretical examples and simulation studies. The approach is used to analyse air pollution data and reveals complex extremal dependence behaviour that is consistent with scientiﬁc understanding of the process. We ﬁnd that the dependence structure exhibits marked seasonality, with extremal dependence between some pollutants being signiﬁcantly greater than the dependence at non-extreme levels.},

A chain-dependent process is assumed as a stochastic model for daily precipitation, with the intensity distribution being the gamma. To examine how the eective return period for extreme high precipitation amounts would change as the parameters of the chain-dependent process change (i.e., probability of a wet day, shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution), a sensitivity analysis is performed. This sensitivity analysis is guided by some results from statistical downscaling that relate patterns in large-scale atmospheric circulation to local precipitation, providing a physically plausible range of changes in the parameters. For the particular location considered in the example, the eective return period is most sensitive to the scale parameter of the intensity distribution. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The statistics of extremes have played an important role in engineering practice for water resources design and management. How recent developments in the statistical theory of extreme values can be applied to improve the rigor of hydrologic applications and to make such analyses more physically meaningful is the central theme of this paper. Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches. Topics that are treated include trends in hydrologic extremes, with the anticipated intensiﬁcation of the hydrologic cycle as part of global climate change. In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere–ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered. Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation. Examples include precipitation and streamﬂow extremes, as well as economic damage associated with such extreme events, with consideration of trends and dependence on patterns in atmosphere–ocean circulation (e.g., El Nin{\textasciitilde}o phenomenon).},

A Gaussian model for the random effects exploits the meteorological structure in the data, enabling increased precision for inferences at individual sites and in individual seasons.

	abstract = {Although information about climate change and its implications is becoming increasingly available to water utility managers, additional tools are needed to translate this information into secondary products useful for local assessments. The anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle makes quantifying changes to hydrologic extremes, as well as associated water quality effects, of particular concern. To this end, this paper focuses on using extreme value statistics to describe maximum monthly flow distributions at a given site, where the nonstationarity is derived from concurrent climate information. From these statistics, flow quantiles are reconstructed over the historic record and then projected to 2100. This paper extends this analysis to an associated source water quality impact, whereby the corresponding risk of exceeding a water quality threshold is examined. The approach is applied to a drinking water source in the Pacific Northwest United States that has experienced elevated turbidity values correlated with high streamflow. Results demonstrate that based on climate change information from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment report, the variability and magnitude of extreme streamflows substantially increase over the 21st century. Consequently, the likelihood of a turbidity exceedance increases, as do the associated relative costs. The framework is general and could be applied to estimate extreme streamflow under climate change at other locations, with straightforward extensions to other water quality variables that depend on extreme hydroclimate.},

	abstract = {Elevated surface ozone during heatwaves and recent hot summers raises concerns over the potential for climate change to exacerbate ozone air pollution in the UK. In this paper, we perform a robust statistical analysis of four decades worth of daily maximum 8-h (MDA8) ozone measurements from the UK’s Automated Urban and Rural Network. A temperature dependent extreme value model is developed to characterise the magnitude and fre­ quency of extreme ozone events and to determine probabilities for ozone exceeding health thresholds, as defined in the UK’s air quality index. Our model is found to describe the tails of the MDA8 ozone distributions well at all 119 monitoring sites considered. For the decade 2010–2019, we estimate that {\textgreater}90\% of sites have a 1-year MDA8 ozone return level greater than the ‘moderate’ ozone threshold of 100 μg/m3. We also find that 33\% of sites are currently expected to breach the UK government’s national air quality objective that MDA8 ozone should not exceed 100 μg/m3 more than ten times per year. We estimate the present overall probability of MDA8 ozone exceeding 100 μg/m3 on a given day to be between {\textless}0.1\% and 5.4\%, depending on site, with averages of 2.7\% (rural) and 1.6\% (urban background locations). Our analysis reveals a significant decline over time in the likelihood of the UK experiencing extreme ozone episodes, with 1-year return levels in the 1980s now roughly comparable to 10-year return levels in the present. Similarly, probabilities of MDA8 ozone exceeding 100 μg/m3 have decreased by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2–6 since the 1980s in some locations. However, our results also highlight a strong positive temperature dependence to the risk of ozone exceedances. In consequence, increasingly hot summers due to climate change may offset some of these gains.},
