We use a transformation to define a vector space on the positive orthant and show that transformed-linear operations applied to regularlyvarying random vectors preserve regular variation. We summarize tail dependence via a matrix of pairwise tail dependence metrics that is positive semidefinite; eigendecomposition allows one to interpret tail dependence in terms of the resulting eigenbasis. This matrix is completely positive, and one can easily construct regularly-varying random vectors that share the same pairwise tail dependencies.

This paper provides a parametric approach to this problem, based on a generalization of the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM). The TPDM gives a partial summary of tail dependence for all pairs of components of the random vector. We propose an algorithm to obtain an approximate completely positive decomposition of the TPDM. The decomposition is easy to compute and applicable to moderate to high dimensions. Based on the decomposition, we obtain parameters estimates of a max-linear model whose TPDM is equal to that of the original random vector.

However, spatial patterns of these extremes and their past and future changes remain unclear. Here, we develop a statistical framework to test for spatial dependence and show widespread dependence of temperature and precipitation extremes in observations and model simulations, with more frequent than expected concurrence of extremes around the world. Historical anthropogenic forcing has strengthened the concurrence of temperature extremes over 56\% of 946 global paired regions, particularly in the tropics, but has not yet significantly affected concurrent precipitation extremes during 1901–2020. The future high-emissions pathway of SSP585 will substantially amplify the concurrence strength, intensity, and spatial extent for both temperature and precipitation extremes, especially over tropical and boreal regions, while the mitigation pathway of SSP126 can ameliorate the increase in concurrent climate extremes for these high-risk regions. Our findings will inform adaptation strategies to alleviate the impact of future climate extremes.           ,              Anthropogenic forcing has altered and will continue to exacerbate the extent and intensity of global concurrent climate extremes.},

We show that the partial tail correlation can be understood as the inner product of the prediction errors from transformed-linear prediction. We connect partial tail correlation to the inverse of the inner product matrix and show that a zero in this inverse implies a partial tail correlation of zero. We then show that under a modeling assumption that the random variables belong to a sensible subset of the inner product space, the matrix of inner products corresponds to the previously-studied tail pairwise dependence matrix. We develop a hypothesis test for partial tail correlation of zero.

  abstract = {Regular variation provides a convenient theoretical framework for studying large events. In the multivariate setting, the spectral measure characterizes the dependence structure of the extremes. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and often has sparse support since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is defined through weak convergence, which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation, which makes it possible to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex, for which efficient algorithms are known. We prove that under mild assumptions sparse regular variation and regular variation are equivalent notions, and we establish several results for sparsely regularly varying random vectors.},

  abstract = {Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g., portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (nonparametric) characterization of extreme dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable ‘‘directions’’ of extremes, i.e., the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the largest observations. Modeling the angular measure in highdimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a particular kind of sparsity within the dependence structure of extremes. This is achieved by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions corresponding to specific sub-cones of Rd+. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a first anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse normal profile of extreme behaviors, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.},

Our approach to this problem exploits hidden regular variation properties on a collection of nonstandard cones, and provides a new set of indices that reveal aspects of the extremal dependence structure not available through existing measures of dependence. We derive theoretical properties of these indices, demonstrate their utility through a series of examples, and develop methods of inference that also estimate the proportion of extremal mass associated with each cone. We apply the methods to river flows in the U.K., estimating the probabilities of different subsets of sites being large simultaneously.},

Appropriate notions of sparsity and connections to other fields such as machine learning, graphical models, and high-dimensional statistics have only recently been established. This article reviews the new domain of research concerned with the detection and modeling of sparse patterns in rare events. We first describe the different forms of extremal dependence that can arise between the largest observations of a multivariate random vector. We then discuss the current research topics, including clustering, principal component analysis, and graphical modeling for extremes. Identification of groups of variables that can be concomitantly extreme is also addressed. The methods are illustrated with an application to flood risk assessment.},

  abstract = {One of the main objectives of statistical climatology is to extract relevant information hidden in complex spatial–temporal climatological datasets. To identify spatial patterns, most well-known statistical techniques are based on the concept of intra- and intercluster variances (like the k-means algorithm or EOFs). As analyzing quantitative extremes like heavy rainfall has become more and more prevalent for climatologists and hydrologists during these last decades, finding spatial patterns with methods based on deviations from the mean (i.e., variances) may not be the most appropriate strategy in this context of studying such extremes. For practitioners, simple and fast clustering tools tailored for extremes have been lacking. A possible avenue to bridging this methodological gap resides in taking advantage of multivariate extreme value theory, a welldeveloped research field in probability, and to adapt it to the context of spatial clustering. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on this plan is proposed and studied.

Defined in terms of a functional parameter, they are one of the most widespread copula families due to their flexibility and ability to capture asymmetry. Despite this, meeting the complex analytical properties of this parameter in an unconstrained setting remains a challenge, restricting most uses to models with very few parameters or nonparametric models. Focusing on the bivariate case, we propose a novel semiparametric approach. Our procedure relies on a series of transformations, including Williamson’s transform and starting from a zero-integral spline. Without further constraints, wholly compliant solutions can be efficiently obtained through maximum likelihood estimation, leveraging gradient optimization. We successfully conducted several experiments on simulated and real-world data. Our method outperforms another well-known nonparametric technique over small and medium-sized samples in various settings. Its expressiveness is illustrated with precious data gathered by the gravitational wave detection LIGO and Virgo collaborations.},

We place ourselves in a Peaks-Over-Threshold framework where a functional extreme is defined as an observation 𝑋 whose 𝐿2-norm ‖𝑋‖ is comparatively large. Our goal is to propose a dimension reduction framework resulting into finite dimensional projections for such extreme observations. Our contribution is double. First, we investigate the notion of Regular Variation for random quantities valued in a general separable Hilbert space, for which we propose a novel concrete characterization involving solely stochastic convergence of real-valued random variables. Second, we propose a notion of functional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accounting for the principal ‘directions’ of functional extremes. We investigate the statistical properties of the empirical covariance operator of the angular component of extreme functions, by upper-bounding the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of the estimation error for finite sample sizes. Numerical experiments with simulated and real data illustrate this work.},

  abstract = {In pattern recognition, a random label Y is to be predicted based upon observing a random vector X valued in Rd with d ≥ 1 by means of a classification rule with minimum probability of error. In a wide variety of applications, ranging from finance/insurance to environmental sciences through teletraffic data analysis for instance, extreme (i.e. very large) observations X are of crucial importance, while contributing in a negligible manner to the (empirical) error however, simply because of their rarity. As a consequence, empirical risk minimizers generally perform very poorly in extreme regions. It is the purpose of this paper to develop a general framework for classification in the extremes. Precisely, under non-parametric heavy-tail assumptions for the class distributions, we prove that a natural and asymptotic notion of risk, accounting for predictive performance in extreme regions of the input space, can be defined and show that minimizers of an empirical version of a non-asymptotic approximant of this dedicated risk, based on a fraction of the largest observations, lead to classification rules with good generalization capacity, by means of maximal deviation inequalities in low probability regions. Beyond theoretical results, numerical experiments are presented in order to illustrate the relevance of the approach developed.},

  abstract = {The approach to analysing compositional data has been dominated by the use of logratio transformations, to ensure exact subcompositional coherence and, in some situations, exact isometry as well. A problem with this approach is that data zeros, found in most applications, have to be replaced to allow the logarithmic transformation. An alternative new approach, called the ‘chiPower’ transformation, which allows data zeros, is to combine the standardization inherent in the chi-square distance in correspondence analysis, with the essential elements of the Box-Cox power transformation. The chiPower transformation is justified because it defines between-sample distances that tend to logratio distances for strictly positive data as the power parameter tends to zero, and are then equivalent to transforming to logratios. For data with zeros, a value of the power can be identified that brings the chiPower transformation as close as possible to a logratio transformation, without having to substitute the zeros. Especially in the area of high-dimensional data, this alternative approach can present such a high level of coherence and isometry as to be a valid approach to the analysis of compositional data. Furthermore, in a supervised learning context, if the compositional variables serve as predictors of a response in a modelling framework, for example generalized linear models, then the power can be used as a tuning parameter in optimizing the accuracy of prediction through cross-validation. The chiPower-transformed variables have a straightforward interpretation, since they are each identified with single compositional parts, not ratios.},

  abstract = {In compositional data analysis, an observation is a vector containing nonnegative values, only the relative sizes of which are considered to be of interest. Without loss of generality, a compositional vector can be taken to be a vector of proportions that sum to one. Data of this type arise in many areas including geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political science. In this paper we investigate methods for classification of compositional data. Our approach centers on the idea of using the α-transformation to transform the data and then to classify the transformed data via regularized discriminant analysis and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Using the α-transformation generalizes two rival approaches in compositional data analysis, one (when α=1) that treats the data as though they were Euclidean, ignoring the compositional constraint, and another (when α = 0) that employs Aitchison’s centered log-ratio transformation. A numerical study with several real datasets shows that whether using α = 1 or α = 0 gives better classification performance depends on the dataset, and moreover that using an intermediate value of α can sometimes give better performance than using either 1 or 0.},

Statistical analyses of this type of data are typically carried out via a log-ratio transformation after replacing zeros with small positive values. We should note, however, that this procedure is geometrically improper, as it causes anomalous distortions through the transformation. We propose a radial transformation that does not require zero substitutions and more importantly results in essential equivalence between domains before and after the transformation. We show that a rich class of kernels on hyperspheres can successfully define a kernel embedding for compositional data based on this equivalence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically establishes the availability of the extensive library of kernel-based machine learning methods for compositional data. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with kernel principal component analysis.},

In this work, a predictive neural network is applied to classify 2,022 National Football League players into the two classifications using scouting combine data of height, weight, and 40-Yard dash time, outperforming the current standard logistic regression. The two measures utilized to compare the strength of the methods were total accuracy and area under ROC curve, with the neural network yielding a slightly higher average in both. In terms of total accuracy, the neural network had an accuracy of 0.9134 to the logistic model’s 0.9065, and in terms of area under ROC curve, the neural network had an area of 0.9578 compared to the logistic model’s 0.9567. As a head-to-head iteration-wise comparison, the neural network had a winning Win-Loss-Tie ratio of 7-2-1 and 5-5-0 in the two measures respectively.},

  abstract = {The National Football League (NFL) Scouting Combine takes place annually for the purpose of allowing NFL teams to evaluate prospects. The battery of six physical tests receives a great deal of attention, and are a focus of team personnel as well as fans of NFL teams. Recently, some have suggested that the current battery of tests should be modified. This work aims to characterize the multivariate dependence structure between tests for Combine prospects, for both typical and elite-level performers, for the purpose of better understanding the current battery of tests before making modifications. Through analysis of two pairwise dependence matrices, one quantifying dependence in the center of the distribution and the other quantifying dependence in the tails of the distribution, this analysis finds that several events show differing levels of association, and that fewer Combine events may be sufficient going forward.},

Their complex structure as the pointwise maximum over an infinite number of random functions makes their simulation difficult. Algorithms based on finite approximations are often inexact and computationally inefficient. We present a new algorithm for exact simulation of a max-stable process at a finite number of locations. It relies on the idea of simulating only the extremal functions, that is, those functions in the construction of a max-stable process that effectively contribute to the pointwise maximum. We further generalize the algorithm by Dieker \& Mikosch (2015) for Brown–Resnick processes and use it for exact simulation via the spectral measure. We study the complexity of both algorithms, prove that our new approach via extremal functions is always more efficient, and provide closed-form expressions for their implementation that cover most popular models for max-stable processes and multivariate extreme value distributions. For simulation on dense grids, an adaptive design of the extremal function algorithm is proposed.},

Our extreme SAR model extends recent work on transformed-linear operations applied to regularly varying random vectors, and is unique among extremes models in being directly analogous to a classical linear model. An additional appeal is its simplicity; given a proximity matrix W, spatial dependence is described by a single parameter 𝜌. We develop an estimation method that minimizes the discrepancy between the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM) for the fitted model and the estimated TPDM. Applying this method to simulated data demonstrates that it is able to produce good estimates of extremal spatial dependence even in the case of model misspecification, and additionally produces reasonable estimates of uncertainty. We also apply the method to gridded precipitation observations for a study region over northeast Colorado, and find that a single-parameter extreme SAR model paired with a neighborhood structure which accounts for longer range dependence effectively models spatial dependence in these data.},

This competition comprised seven teams competing across four separate sub-challenges, with each requiring the modelling of data simulated from known, yet highly complex, statistical distributions, and extrapolation far beyond the range of the available samples in order to predict probabilities of extreme events.

A heat wave definition based on EPI is able to detect the most important heat waves over Europe. As an extension for considering simultaneous extremes in two variables, we propose the threshold-based EPI (TEPI) that captures the compound character of spatial extremes. We investigate daily temperature maxima and precipitation deficits at different accumulation times and find evidence that preceding precipitation deficits have a significant influence on the development of heat waves and that heat waves often co-occur with short-term drought conditions.

We first investigate consistency requirements among the finite-dimensional collections of the elements of a regularly-varying time series. We define the tail pairwise dependence function (TPDF) to quantify the extremal dependence between two elements of the regularly-varying time series, and use the TPDF to define the concept of weak tail stationarity for regularly-varying time series. To develop our non-negative regularly-varying ARMA-like time series models, we use transformed-linear operations. We show existence and stationarity of these models and develop their properties, such as the model TPDF’s. Motivated by investigating conditions conducive to the spread of wildfires, we fit models to hourly windspeed data and find that the fitted transformed-linear models produce better estimates of upper tail quantities than alternative models.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel extremal dependence measure called the partial tail-correlation coefficient (PTCC), in analogy to the partial correlation coefficient in classical multivariate analysis. The construction of our new coefficient is based on the framework of multivariate regular variation and transformed-linear algebra operations. We show how this coefficient allows identifying pairs of variables that have partially uncorrelated tails given some other variables in a random vector. Unlike other recently introduced conditional independence frameworks for extremes, our approach requires minimal modeling assumptions and can thus be used in exploratory analyses to learn the structure of extremal graphical models. Similarly to traditional Gaussian graphical models where edges correspond to the nonzero entries of the precision matrix, we can exploit classical inference methods for high-dimensional data, such as the graphical Lasso with Laplacian spectral constraints, to efficiently learn the extremal network structure via the PTCC. We apply our new method to study extreme risk networks in two different datasets (extreme river discharges and historical global currency exchange data) and show that we can extract interesting extremal structures with meaningful domainspecific interpretations.},

In a number of applications, no pre-processing of the data is carried out, and it is the uncentred data matrix that is subjected to an SVD, in what is often called an uncentred PCA. This paper explores the relationships between the results from both the standard, column-centred, PCA, and its uncentred counterpart. In particular, it obtains both exact results and bounds relating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariation matrices, as well as the principal components, in both types of analysis. These relationships highlight how the eigenvalues of both the covariance matrix and the matrix of non-central second moments contain much information that is highly informative for a comparative assessment of PCA and its uncentred variant. The relations and the examples also suggest that the results of both types of PCA have more in common than might be supposed.},

A heuristic criterion is proposed to choose the threshold over which it is acceptable to consider observations as extreme and the appropriate number of clusters. When empirically evaluated through numerical experiments, the approach we promote here is found to be very efficient under some regularity constraints, even in dimension 20.

  abstract = {Regular variation provides a convenient theoretical framework to study large events. In the multivariate setting, the dependence structure of the positive extremes is characterized by a measure - the spectral measure - defined on the positive orthant of the unit sphere. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and is often sparse since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is defined through weak convergence which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation which allows to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex for which efficient algorithms are known. We show several results for sparsely regularly varying random vectors and prove that under mild assumptions sparse regular variation and regular variation are two equivalent notions. Finally, we provide numerical evidence of our theoretical findings and compare our method with a recent one developed by Goix et al. (2017).},

The main types of statistical models thus far proposed, based on latent variables, on copulas and on spatial max-stable processes, are described and then are compared by application to a data set on rainfall in Switzerland. Whereas latent variable modeling allows a better fit to marginal distributions, it fits the joint distributions of extremes poorly, so appropriately-chosen copula or max-stable models seem essential for successful spatial modeling of extremes.

  abstract = {Maps of extreme snow depths are important for structural design and general risk assessment in mountainous countries like Austria. The smooth modeling approach is commonly accepted to provide more accurate margins than max-stable processes. In contrast, max-stable models allow for risk estimation due to explicitly available spatial extremal dependencies, in particular when anisotropy is accounted for. However, the difference in return levels is unclear, when modeled smoothly or with max-stable processes. The objective of this study is twofold: first, to investigate that question and to provide snow depth return level maps for Austria; and second, to investigate spatial dependencies of extreme snow depths in Austria in detail and to find a suitable model for risk estimation. Therefore, a model selection procedure was used to define a marginal model for the GEV parameters. This model was fitted to 210 snow depth series comprising a length of 42 years using the smooth model approach and different max-stable models allowing for anisotropy. Despite relatively clear advantages for the Extremal-t maxstable process based on two scores compared to the smooth model as well as the Brown–Resnick, Geometric Gaussian and Schlather processes, the difference in 100-year snow depth return levels is too small, to decide which approach works better. Spatial dependencies of snow depth extremes between the regions north and south of the Austrian Alps are almost independent. Dependencies are stronger in the south for small distances between station pairs up to 120 km and become stronger in the north for larger distances. For risk modeling the Austrian Alps could be separated into regions north and south of the Alps. Fitting an anisotropic Extremal-t max-stable process to either side of the Alps can improve modeling of joint exceedance probabilities compared to one single model for the whole of Austria, especially for small station distances.},

The theory of multivariate and spatial extremes describes the risk of rare events through asymptotically justified limit models such as max-stable and multivariate Pareto distributions. Statistical modelling in this field has been limited to moderate dimensions so far, partly owing to complicated likelihoods and a lack of understanding of the underlying probabilistic structures. We introduce a general theory of conditional independence for multivariate Pareto distributions that allows the definition of graphical models and sparsity for extremes. A Hammersley–Clifford theorem links this new notion to the factorization of densities of extreme value models on graphs. For the popular class of Hu¨sler–Reiss distributions we show that, similarly to the Gaussian case, the sparsity pattern of a general extremal graphical model can be read off from suitable inverse covariance matrices. New parametric models can be built in a modular way and statistical inference can be simplified to lower-dimensional marginals. We discuss learning of minimum spanning trees and model selection for extremal graph structures, and illustrate their use with an application to flood risk assessment on the Danube river.},

Multivariate peaks-over-threshold methods, in contrast, exploit additional information from the non-aggregated 'large' observations. We introduce an approach based on peaks over thresholds that provides several new estimators for processes 77 in the max-domain of attraction of the frequently used Hüsler-Reiss model and its spatial extension: Brown-Resnick processes. The method relies on increments //(•) - r;(f0) conditional on r/(f0) exceeding a high threshold, where t0 is a fixed location. When the marginals are standardized to the Gumbel distribution, these increments asymptotically form a Gaussian process resulting in computationally simple estimates of the Hüsler-Reiss parameter matrix and particularly enables parametric inference for Brown-Resnick processes based on (high dimensional) multivariate densities. This is a major advantage over composite likelihood methods that are commonly used in spatial extreme value statistics since they rely only on bivariate densities. A simulation study compares the performance of the new estimators with other commonly used methods. As an application, we fit a non-isotropic Brown-Resnick process to the extremes of 12-year data of daily wind speed measurements.},

Inference with such models has been challenging due to the lack of tractable likelihoods which has motivated use of composite likelihood methods Padoan et al. (J. Amer. Stat. Assoc. 105(489):263–277, 2010). In contrast, the finite dimensional cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) appear natural to work with, and are readily available or can be approximated well. Motivated by this fact, in this work we develop an M-estimation framework for max-stable models based on the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) of multivariate CDFs. We start by establishing conditions for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the CRPSbased estimators in a general context. We then implement them in the max-stable setting and provide readily computable expressions for their asymptotic covariance matrices. The resulting point and asymptotic confidence interval estimates are illustrated over popular simulated models. They enjoy accurate coverages and offer an alternative to composite likelihood based methods.},

  abstract = {Likelihood-based procedures are a common way to estimate tail dependence parameters. They are not applicable, however, in non-differentiable models such as those arising from recent max-linear structural equation models. Moreover, they can be hard to compute in higher dimensions. An adaptive weighted leastsquares procedure matching nonparametric estimates of the stable tail dependence function with the corresponding values of a parametrically specified proposal yields a novel minimum-distance estimator. The estimator is easy to calculate and applies to a wide range of sampling schemes and tail dependence models. In large samples, it is asymptotically normal with an explicit and estimable covariance matrix. The minimum distance obtained forms the basis of a goodness-of-fit statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chi-square. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm the excellent finite-sample performance of the estimator and demonstrate that it is a strong competitor to currently available methods. The estimator is then applied to disentangle sources of tail dependence in European stock markets.},

  abstract = {Extremal dependence of the losses in a portfolio is one of the most important features that should be accounted for when estimating Value-at-Risk (VaR) at high levels. Multivariate extreme value theory provides a principled framework for the modeling and estimation of extremal dependence. In practice, however, this involves dealing with a challenging infinite dimensional parameter such as the spectral measure. Here, following recent developments in Schlather and Tawn (Extremes 5(1), 87–102, 2002), Molchanov (Extremes 11, 235–259, 2008), and Strokorb and Schlather (2013), we propose to represent extremal dependence of a multivariate portfolio via the so–called Tawn–Molchanov (TM) model, which is finite dimensional. Every max–stable random vector X can be associated with a TM max-stable vector Y = TM(X) so that the extremal coefficients of X and Y match and at the same time Y stochastically dominates X in the lower orthant order. This result readily yields an optimal upper bound on the value-at-risk VaRα(X∨) of the maximum portfolio loss X∨ := maxj=1,...,d Xj . We develop a statistical methodology for estimating TM models from data and illustrate the resulting upper bounds on VaRα(X∨) with simulations and real data. Fitting TM models to portfolio data may be of independent practical interest, since their coefficients provide a qualitative picture of the degree and nature of diversification to extreme shocks.},

  abstract = {Among bivariate tail dependence measures, the tail dependence coefficient has emerged as the popular choice. Akin to the correlation matrix, a multivariate dependence measure is constructed using these bivariate measures, and this is referred to in the literature as the tail dependence matrix (TDM). While the problem of determining whether a given d × d matrix is a correlation matrix is of the order O(d3) in complexity, determining if a matrix is a TDM (the realization problem) is believed to be non-polynomial in complexity. Using a linear programming (LP) formulation, we show that the combinatorial structure of the constraints is related to the intractable max-cut problem in a weighted graph. This connection provides an avenue for constructing parametric classes admitting a polynomial in d algorithm for determining membership in its constraint polytope. The complexity of the general realization problem is justifiably of much theoretical interest. Since in practice one resorts to lower dimensional parametrization of the TDMs, we posit that it is rather the complexity of the realization problem restricted to parametric classes of TDMs, and algorithms for it, that are more practically relevant. In this paper, we show how the inherent symmetry and sparsity in a parametrization can be exploited to achieve a significant reduction in the LP formulation, which can lead to polynomial complexity of such realization problems - some parametrizations even resulting in the constraint polytope being independent of d. We also explore the use of a probabilistic viewpoint on TDMs to derive the constraint polytopes.},

From this it has long been assumed that this implies that the question of whether or not the strong membership problem for the dual of the copositive cone, the completely positive cone, is also an NP-hard problem. However, the technical details for this have not previously been looked at to confirm that this is true. In this paper it is proven that the strong membership problem for the completely positive cone is indeed NP-hard. Furthermore, it is shown that even the weak membership problems for both of these cones are NP-hard. We also present an alternative proof of the NP-hardness of the strong membership problem for the copositive cone.},

We propose a scaling technique and use scaling parameters in order to determine a causality re-ordering of the node variables that makes the underlying DAG well-ordered. We show how one can compute all dependence parameters by using scalings.

This paper is a statistical extreme-event risk attribution study that aims to answer whether extreme wildfire seasons are more likely now than under past climate. This requires modeling temporal dependence at extreme levels. We propose the use of transformed-linear time series models, which are constructed similarly to traditional autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models while having a dependence structure that is tied to a widely used framework for extremes (regular variation). We fit the models to the extreme values of the seasonally adjusted fire weather index (FWI) time series to capture the dependence in the upper tail for past and present climate. We simulate 10 000 fire seasons from each fitted model and compare the proportion of simulated high-risk fire seasons to quantify the increase in risk. Our method suggests that the risk of experiencing an extreme wildfire season in Grand Lake, Colorado, under current climate has increased dramatically relative to the risk under the climate of the mid-twentieth century. Our method also finds some evidence of increased risk of extreme wildfire seasons in Quincy, California, but large uncertainties do not allow us to reject a null hypothesis of no change.},

More specifically, we focus on the asymptotic dependence of multivariate extremes characterized by the angular or spectral measure in extreme value theory and provide a careful analysis in the case where the extremes are generated from a linear factor model. We give theoretical guarantees on the performance of kernel PCA preimages of such extremes by leveraging their asymptotic distribution together with Davis-Kahan perturbation bounds.

  abstract = {A square matrix A is completely positive if A = BBT , where B is a (not necessarily square) nonnegative matrix. In general, a completely positive matrix may have many, even infinitely many, such CP factorizations. But in some cases a unique CP factorization exists. We prove a simple necessary and sufficient condition for a completely positive matrix whose graph is triangle free to have a unique CP factorization. This implies uniqueness of the CP factorization for some other matrices on the boundary of the cone CPn of n × n completely positive matrices. We also describe the minimal face of CPn containing a completely positive A. If A has a unique CP factorization, this face is polyhedral.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We aim to factorize a completely positive matrix by using an optimization approach which consists in the minimization of a nonconvex smooth function over a convex and compact set. To solve this problem we propose a projected gradient algorithm with parameters that take into account the effects of relaxation and inertia. Both projection and gradient steps are simple in the sense that they have explicit formulas and do not require inner loops. Furthermore, no expensive procedure to find an appropriate starting point is needed. The convergence analysis shows that the whole sequence of generated iterates converges to a critical point of the objective function and it makes use of the Łojasiewicz inequality. Its rate of convergence expressed in terms of the Łojasiewicz exponent of a regularization of the objective function is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, in particular in comparison to other factorization algorithms, and emphasize the role of the relaxation and inertial parameters.},

  abstract = {Modeling dependencies between climate extremes is important for climate risk assessment, for instance when allocating emergency management funds. In statistics, multivariate extreme value theory is often used to model spatial extremes. However, most commonly used approaches require strong assumptions and are either too simplistic or over-parameterized. From a machine learning perspective, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a powerful tool to model dependencies in high-dimensional spaces. Yet in the standard setting, GANs do not well represent dependencies in the extremes. Here we combine GANs with extreme value theory (evtGAN) to model spatial dependencies in summer maxima of temperature and winter maxima in precipitation over a large part of western Europe. We use data from a stationary 2000-year climate model simulation to validate the approach and explore its sensitivity to small sample sizes. Our results show that evtGAN outperforms classical GANs and standard statistical approaches to model spatial extremes. Already with about 50 years of data, which corresponds to commonly available climate records, we obtain reasonably good performance. In general, dependencies between temperature extremes are better captured than dependencies between precipitation extremes due to the high spatial coherence in temperature fields. Our approach can be applied to other climate variables and can be used to emulate climate models when running very long simulations to determine dependencies in the extremes is deemed infeasible.},

  abstract = {The lower tail dependence lL is a measure that characterizes the tendency of extreme co-movements in the lower tails of a bivariate distribution. It is invariant with respect to strictly increasing transformations of the marginal distribution and is therefore a function of the copula of the bivariate distribution. lL plays an important role in modelling aggregate financial risk with copulas. This paper introduces three non-parametric estimators for lL. They are weakly consistent under mild regularity conditions on the copula and under the assumption that pthffiffie number k ¼ k(n) of observations in the lower tail, used for estimation, is asymptotically k \% n. The finite sample properties of the estimators are investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation in special cases. It turns out that these estimators are biased, where amount and sign of the bias depend on the underlying copula, on the sample size n, on k, and on the true value of lL.},
