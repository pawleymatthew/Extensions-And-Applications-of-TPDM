We use a transformation to define a vector space on the positive orthant and show that transformed-linear operations applied to regularlyvarying random vectors preserve regular variation. We summarize tail dependence via a matrix of pairwise tail dependence metrics that is positive semidefinite; eigendecomposition allows one to interpret tail dependence in terms of the resulting eigenbasis. This matrix is completely positive, and one can easily construct regularly-varying random vectors that share the same pairwise tail dependencies.

This paper provides a parametric approach to this problem, based on a generalization of the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM). The TPDM gives a partial summary of tail dependence for all pairs of components of the random vector. We propose an algorithm to obtain an approximate completely positive decomposition of the TPDM. The decomposition is easy to compute and applicable to moderate to high dimensions. Based on the decomposition, we obtain parameters estimates of a max-linear model whose TPDM is equal to that of the original random vector.

However, spatial patterns of these extremes and their past and future changes remain unclear. Here, we develop a statistical framework to test for spatial dependence and show widespread dependence of temperature and precipitation extremes in observations and model simulations, with more frequent than expected concurrence of extremes around the world. Historical anthropogenic forcing has strengthened the concurrence of temperature extremes over 56\% of 946 global paired regions, particularly in the tropics, but has not yet significantly affected concurrent precipitation extremes during 1901–2020. The future high-emissions pathway of SSP585 will substantially amplify the concurrence strength, intensity, and spatial extent for both temperature and precipitation extremes, especially over tropical and boreal regions, while the mitigation pathway of SSP126 can ameliorate the increase in concurrent climate extremes for these high-risk regions. Our findings will inform adaptation strategies to alleviate the impact of future climate extremes.           ,              Anthropogenic forcing has altered and will continue to exacerbate the extent and intensity of global concurrent climate extremes.},

We show that the partial tail correlation can be understood as the inner product of the prediction errors from transformed-linear prediction. We connect partial tail correlation to the inverse of the inner product matrix and show that a zero in this inverse implies a partial tail correlation of zero. We then show that under a modeling assumption that the random variables belong to a sensible subset of the inner product space, the matrix of inner products corresponds to the previously-studied tail pairwise dependence matrix. We develop a hypothesis test for partial tail correlation of zero.

  abstract = {Regular variation provides a convenient theoretical framework for studying large events. In the multivariate setting, the spectral measure characterizes the dependence structure of the extremes. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and often has sparse support since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is defined through weak convergence, which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation, which makes it possible to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex, for which efficient algorithms are known. We prove that under mild assumptions sparse regular variation and regular variation are equivalent notions, and we establish several results for sparsely regularly varying random vectors.},

  abstract = {Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g., portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (nonparametric) characterization of extreme dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable ‘‘directions’’ of extremes, i.e., the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the largest observations. Modeling the angular measure in highdimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a particular kind of sparsity within the dependence structure of extremes. This is achieved by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions corresponding to specific sub-cones of Rd+. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a first anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse normal profile of extreme behaviors, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.},

Our approach to this problem exploits hidden regular variation properties on a collection of nonstandard cones, and provides a new set of indices that reveal aspects of the extremal dependence structure not available through existing measures of dependence. We derive theoretical properties of these indices, demonstrate their utility through a series of examples, and develop methods of inference that also estimate the proportion of extremal mass associated with each cone. We apply the methods to river flows in the U.K., estimating the probabilities of different subsets of sites being large simultaneously.},

Appropriate notions of sparsity and connections to other fields such as machine learning, graphical models, and high-dimensional statistics have only recently been established. This article reviews the new domain of research concerned with the detection and modeling of sparse patterns in rare events. We first describe the different forms of extremal dependence that can arise between the largest observations of a multivariate random vector. We then discuss the current research topics, including clustering, principal component analysis, and graphical modeling for extremes. Identification of groups of variables that can be concomitantly extreme is also addressed. The methods are illustrated with an application to flood risk assessment.},

  abstract = {One of the main objectives of statistical climatology is to extract relevant information hidden in complex spatial–temporal climatological datasets. To identify spatial patterns, most well-known statistical techniques are based on the concept of intra- and intercluster variances (like the k-means algorithm or EOFs). As analyzing quantitative extremes like heavy rainfall has become more and more prevalent for climatologists and hydrologists during these last decades, finding spatial patterns with methods based on deviations from the mean (i.e., variances) may not be the most appropriate strategy in this context of studying such extremes. For practitioners, simple and fast clustering tools tailored for extremes have been lacking. A possible avenue to bridging this methodological gap resides in taking advantage of multivariate extreme value theory, a welldeveloped research field in probability, and to adapt it to the context of spatial clustering. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on this plan is proposed and studied.

Defined in terms of a functional parameter, they are one of the most widespread copula families due to their flexibility and ability to capture asymmetry. Despite this, meeting the complex analytical properties of this parameter in an unconstrained setting remains a challenge, restricting most uses to models with very few parameters or nonparametric models. Focusing on the bivariate case, we propose a novel semiparametric approach. Our procedure relies on a series of transformations, including Williamson’s transform and starting from a zero-integral spline. Without further constraints, wholly compliant solutions can be efficiently obtained through maximum likelihood estimation, leveraging gradient optimization. We successfully conducted several experiments on simulated and real-world data. Our method outperforms another well-known nonparametric technique over small and medium-sized samples in various settings. Its expressiveness is illustrated with precious data gathered by the gravitational wave detection LIGO and Virgo collaborations.},

We place ourselves in a Peaks-Over-Threshold framework where a functional extreme is defined as an observation 𝑋 whose 𝐿2-norm ‖𝑋‖ is comparatively large. Our goal is to propose a dimension reduction framework resulting into finite dimensional projections for such extreme observations. Our contribution is double. First, we investigate the notion of Regular Variation for random quantities valued in a general separable Hilbert space, for which we propose a novel concrete characterization involving solely stochastic convergence of real-valued random variables. Second, we propose a notion of functional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accounting for the principal ‘directions’ of functional extremes. We investigate the statistical properties of the empirical covariance operator of the angular component of extreme functions, by upper-bounding the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of the estimation error for finite sample sizes. Numerical experiments with simulated and real data illustrate this work.},

  abstract = {In pattern recognition, a random label Y is to be predicted based upon observing a random vector X valued in Rd with d ≥ 1 by means of a classification rule with minimum probability of error. In a wide variety of applications, ranging from finance/insurance to environmental sciences through teletraffic data analysis for instance, extreme (i.e. very large) observations X are of crucial importance, while contributing in a negligible manner to the (empirical) error however, simply because of their rarity. As a consequence, empirical risk minimizers generally perform very poorly in extreme regions. It is the purpose of this paper to develop a general framework for classification in the extremes. Precisely, under non-parametric heavy-tail assumptions for the class distributions, we prove that a natural and asymptotic notion of risk, accounting for predictive performance in extreme regions of the input space, can be defined and show that minimizers of an empirical version of a non-asymptotic approximant of this dedicated risk, based on a fraction of the largest observations, lead to classification rules with good generalization capacity, by means of maximal deviation inequalities in low probability regions. Beyond theoretical results, numerical experiments are presented in order to illustrate the relevance of the approach developed.},

  abstract = {The approach to analysing compositional data has been dominated by the use of logratio transformations, to ensure exact subcompositional coherence and, in some situations, exact isometry as well. A problem with this approach is that data zeros, found in most applications, have to be replaced to allow the logarithmic transformation. An alternative new approach, called the ‘chiPower’ transformation, which allows data zeros, is to combine the standardization inherent in the chi-square distance in correspondence analysis, with the essential elements of the Box-Cox power transformation. The chiPower transformation is justified because it defines between-sample distances that tend to logratio distances for strictly positive data as the power parameter tends to zero, and are then equivalent to transforming to logratios. For data with zeros, a value of the power can be identified that brings the chiPower transformation as close as possible to a logratio transformation, without having to substitute the zeros. Especially in the area of high-dimensional data, this alternative approach can present such a high level of coherence and isometry as to be a valid approach to the analysis of compositional data. Furthermore, in a supervised learning context, if the compositional variables serve as predictors of a response in a modelling framework, for example generalized linear models, then the power can be used as a tuning parameter in optimizing the accuracy of prediction through cross-validation. The chiPower-transformed variables have a straightforward interpretation, since they are each identified with single compositional parts, not ratios.},

Without loss of generality, a compositional vector can be taken to be a vector of proportions that sum to one. Data of this type arise in many areas including geology, archaeology, biology, economics and political science. In this paper we investigate methods for classification of compositional data. Our approach centers on the idea of using the α-transformation to transform the data and then to classify the transformed data via regularized discriminant analysis and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Using the α-transformation generalizes two rival approaches in compositional data analysis, one (when α=1) that treats the data as though they were Euclidean, ignoring the compositional constraint, and another (when α = 0) that employs Aitchison’s centered log-ratio transformation. A numerical study with several real datasets shows that whether using α = 1 or α = 0 gives better classification performance depends on the dataset, and moreover that using an intermediate value of α can sometimes give better performance than using either 1 or 0.},

Statistical analyses of this type of data are typically carried out via a log-ratio transformation after replacing zeros with small positive values. We should note, however, that this procedure is geometrically improper, as it causes anomalous distortions through the transformation. We propose a radial transformation that does not require zero substitutions and more importantly results in essential equivalence between domains before and after the transformation. We show that a rich class of kernels on hyperspheres can successfully define a kernel embedding for compositional data based on this equivalence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that theoretically establishes the availability of the extensive library of kernel-based machine learning methods for compositional data. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with kernel principal component analysis.},

In this work, a predictive neural network is applied to classify 2,022 National Football League players into the two classifications using scouting combine data of height, weight, and 40-Yard dash time, outperforming the current standard logistic regression. The two measures utilized to compare the strength of the methods were total accuracy and area under ROC curve, with the neural network yielding a slightly higher average in both. In terms of total accuracy, the neural network had an accuracy of 0.9134 to the logistic model’s 0.9065, and in terms of area under ROC curve, the neural network had an area of 0.9578 compared to the logistic model’s 0.9567. As a head-to-head iteration-wise comparison, the neural network had a winning Win-Loss-Tie ratio of 7-2-1 and 5-5-0 in the two measures respectively.},

  abstract = {The National Football League (NFL) Scouting Combine takes place annually for the purpose of allowing NFL teams to evaluate prospects. The battery of six physical tests receives a great deal of attention, and are a focus of team personnel as well as fans of NFL teams. Recently, some have suggested that the current battery of tests should be modified. This work aims to characterize the multivariate dependence structure between tests for Combine prospects, for both typical and elite-level performers, for the purpose of better understanding the current battery of tests before making modifications. Through analysis of two pairwise dependence matrices, one quantifying dependence in the center of the distribution and the other quantifying dependence in the tails of the distribution, this analysis finds that several events show differing levels of association, and that fewer Combine events may be sufficient going forward.},

Their complex structure as the pointwise maximum over an infinite number of random functions makes their simulation difficult. Algorithms based on finite approximations are often inexact and computationally inefficient. We present a new algorithm for exact simulation of a max-stable process at a finite number of locations. It relies on the idea of simulating only the extremal functions, that is, those functions in the construction of a max-stable process that effectively contribute to the pointwise maximum. We further generalize the algorithm by Dieker \& Mikosch (2015) for Brown–Resnick processes and use it for exact simulation via the spectral measure. We study the complexity of both algorithms, prove that our new approach via extremal functions is always more efficient, and provide closed-form expressions for their implementation that cover most popular models for max-stable processes and multivariate extreme value distributions. For simulation on dense grids, an adaptive design of the extremal function algorithm is proposed.},

Our extreme SAR model extends recent work on transformed-linear operations applied to regularly varying random vectors, and is unique among extremes models in being directly analogous to a classical linear model. An additional appeal is its simplicity; given a proximity matrix W, spatial dependence is described by a single parameter 𝜌. We develop an estimation method that minimizes the discrepancy between the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM) for the fitted model and the estimated TPDM. Applying this method to simulated data demonstrates that it is able to produce good estimates of extremal spatial dependence even in the case of model misspecification, and additionally produces reasonable estimates of uncertainty. We also apply the method to gridded precipitation observations for a study region over northeast Colorado, and find that a single-parameter extreme SAR model paired with a neighborhood structure which accounts for longer range dependence effectively models spatial dependence in these data.},

This competition comprised seven teams competing across four separate sub-challenges, with each requiring the modelling of data simulated from known, yet highly complex, statistical distributions, and extrapolation far beyond the range of the available samples in order to predict probabilities of extreme events.

A heat wave definition based on EPI is able to detect the most important heat waves over Europe. As an extension for considering simultaneous extremes in two variables, we propose the threshold-based EPI (TEPI) that captures the compound character of spatial extremes. We investigate daily temperature maxima and precipitation deficits at different accumulation times and find evidence that preceding precipitation deficits have a significant influence on the development of heat waves and that heat waves often co-occur with short-term drought conditions.

  abstract = {In order to capture the dependence in the upper tail of a time series, we develop non-negative regularlyvarying time series models that are constructed similarly to classical non-extreme ARMA models. We first investigate consistency requirements among the finite-dimensional collections of the elements of a regularly-varying time series. We define the tail pairwise dependence function (TPDF) to quantify the extremal dependence between two elements of the regularly-varying time series, and use the TPDF to define the concept of weak tail stationarity for regularly-varying time series. To develop our non-negative regularly-varying ARMA-like time series models, we use transformed-linear operations. We show existence and stationarity of these models and develop their properties, such as the model TPDF’s. Motivated by investigating conditions conducive to the spread of wildfires, we fit models to hourly windspeed data and find that the fitted transformed-linear models produce better estimates of upper tail quantities than alternative models.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel extremal dependence measure called the partial tail-correlation coefficient (PTCC), in analogy to the partial correlation coefficient in classical multivariate analysis. The construction of our new coefficient is based on the framework of multivariate regular variation and transformed-linear algebra operations. We show how this coefficient allows identifying pairs of variables that have partially uncorrelated tails given some other variables in a random vector. Unlike other recently introduced conditional independence frameworks for extremes, our approach requires minimal modeling assumptions and can thus be used in exploratory analyses to learn the structure of extremal graphical models. Similarly to traditional Gaussian graphical models where edges correspond to the nonzero entries of the precision matrix, we can exploit classical inference methods for high-dimensional data, such as the graphical Lasso with Laplacian spectral constraints, to efficiently learn the extremal network structure via the PTCC. We apply our new method to study extreme risk networks in two different datasets (extreme river discharges and historical global currency exchange data) and show that we can extract interesting extremal structures with meaningful domainspecific interpretations.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) can be seen as a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a column-centred data matrix. In a number of applications, no pre-processing of the data is carried out, and it is the uncentred data matrix that is subjected to an SVD, in what is often called an uncentred PCA. This paper explores the relationships between the results from both the standard, column-centred, PCA, and its uncentred counterpart. In particular, it obtains both exact results and bounds relating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariation matrices, as well as the principal components, in both types of analysis. These relationships highlight how the eigenvalues of both the covariance matrix and the matrix of non-central second moments contain much information that is highly informative for a comparative assessment of PCA and its uncentred variant. The relations and the examples also suggest that the results of both types of PCA have more in common than might be supposed.},

  abstract = {Non-parametric assessment of extreme dependence structures between an arbitrary number of variables, though quite well-established in dimension 2 and recently extended to moderate dimensions such as 5, still represents a statistical challenge in larger dimensions. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines clustering techniques with angular/spectral measure analysis to find groups of variables (not necessarily disjoint) exhibiting asymptotic dependence, thereby reducing the dimension of the initial problem. A heuristic criterion is proposed to choose the threshold over which it is acceptable to consider observations as extreme and the appropriate number of clusters. When empirically evaluated through numerical experiments, the approach we promote here is found to be very efficient under some regularity constraints, even in dimension 20. For illustration purpose, we also carry out a case study in dietary risk assessment.},

More specifically, we focus on the asymptotic dependence of multivariate extremes characterized by the angular or spectral measure in extreme value theory. Our work studies the theoretical performance of spectral clustering based on a random k-nearest neighbor graph constructed from an extremal sample, i.e., the angular part of random vectors for which the radius exceeds a large threshold. In particular, we derive the asymptotic distribution of extremes arising from a linear factor model and prove that, under certain conditions, spectral clustering can consistently identify the clusters of extremes arising in this model. Leveraging this result we propose a simple consistent estimation strategy for learning the angular measure. Our theoretical findings are complemented with numerical experiments illustrating the finite sample performance of our methods.},

  abstract = {Regular variation provides a convenient theoretical framework to study large events. In the multivariate setting, the dependence structure of the positive extremes is characterized by a measure - the spectral measure - defined on the positive orthant of the unit sphere. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and is often sparse since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is defined through weak convergence which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation which allows to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex for which efficient algorithms are known. We show several results for sparsely regularly varying random vectors and prove that under mild assumptions sparse regular variation and regular variation are two equivalent notions. Finally, we provide numerical evidence of our theoretical findings and compare our method with a recent one developed by Goix et al. (2017).},
